Austerity
=========

A Chrome Packaged App web server

Run it
------
Clone into [Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg) and you're running a server!

You might need to open a firewall port on your computer ([Chrome OS doesn't have that ability](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=233052)).

Testing
-------
Install [`jasmine-node`](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node), then `test\run`
